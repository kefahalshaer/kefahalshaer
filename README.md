With a deep passion for **NLP applications** like building Generative AI-integrated products, and I am also interested in working with visual datasets. I'm working now as a **Machine Learning Engineer on Upwork**, and got the **Kaggle bronze medals** for developing a recommendation system and forecasting for a bike-share system.
